        A friend who is just getting started on learning programming reached out
        to me and asked: "... is learning the meaning/usage/definition of a
        command line the most important about coding? ... I can probably search
        all the [command lines] of a specific program on google[,] and syntax is
        too annoying. ... I want to understand how to 'learn' first." I thought he
        was referring to command line (cli), so I gave him some background of
        command line and the difference between cli and GUI programs.
        However, I realized I was quick to assume because he later aligned me on
        what he was trying to understand, which is if he should memorize all the
        syntax of the language he's trying to learn.
        That got me thinking back to how I started -- I, too, was unsure of where
        to begin and what questions to ask. Right questions/words are the north
        stars in the journey. So *direction* is crutial in learning, not just
        programming but all other disciplines as well.
        Helping people get started in learning how to code is part of the main
        reason why I started this *posts* section.

        Going back to my friend's original question, I answered him with the
        analogy of spoken languages: Programming languages' syntax is analogous to
        our spoken languages' grammar, alphabets/characters, and words. It's
        normal to not have all the syntax of a programming language memorized when
        you are just getting started. It's like most people don't know all the
        English words or words in other languages. That's why dictionaries and
        documents of grammar rules exist, and that's why we have documentation in
        programming languages. Most of us as professionals rely on documentation
        of the technology/language we use all the time. It's completely normal to
        not be able to memorize everything.
        <br />
        To extend the conversation a little further, I added that if he's going to
        call himself an xxx (name of programming language) programmer, then he is
        assumed to speak the language fluently, meaning, he should not rely
        heavily on documentation on basic syntax.
      </p>

        Of course, I encouraged him to have fun at the end of the conversation.
        It's an important part of learning.
